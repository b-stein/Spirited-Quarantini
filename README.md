## Overview

A group [project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/stretch.html) at Turing School of Software and Design.

Spirited Quarantini is an application using [The Cocktail Database](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/). It helps teach others how to bartend from the comfort of their own home. With over 100 recipes to learn how to make delicious, refreshing beverages with confidence. 

Users can login, search cocktails by ingredient type or name, view a randomized cocktail of the day, read up on cocktail instructions, and save or mark as tried for any drink.

## Learning Goals
- Implement a new technology in an app creation: TypeScript and React Hooks
- Cover application with a robust testing suite, using Jest and React Testing Library
